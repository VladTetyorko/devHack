## Current Monolithic Architecture

The DevHack application currently follows a traditional monolithic architecture with the following components:

### Core Components

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic divided into:
  - **Domain Services**: Core business operations
  - **View Services**: Presentation logic
  - **API Services**: External integrations (OpenAI, GPT-J)
- **Repository Layer**: Data access using Spring Data JPA
- **Model Layer**: Domain entities and data transfer objects

### Business Domains

The application encompasses several business domains:

1. **User Management**: User registration, authentication, and profiles
2. **Interview Questions**: Creation, management, and generation of interview questions
3. **Answers**: Management of answers to interview questions
4. **Vacancy Responses**: Tracking job applications and interview processes
5. **Notes**: Personal notes for various entities
6. **Tags**: Categorization system for questions and other entities
7. **AI Integration**: Question generation using AI services

### Current Limitations

- **Scalability Issues**: The monolithic architecture makes it difficult to scale individual components based on demand
- **Deployment Challenges**: Any change requires redeploying the entire application
- **Technology Constraints**: All components must use the same technology stack
- **Development Bottlenecks**: Multiple teams working on the same codebase can lead to conflicts

## Proposed Microservices Architecture

The proposed microservices architecture divides the application into several independent services, each responsible for a specific business domain:

### Core Microservices

1. **User Service**
   - User registration and authentication
   - User profile management
   - Authorization and permissions

2. **Question Service**

   - Question search and filtering

3. **Answer Service**
   - Answer management
   - Answer evaluation
   - Answer statistics

4. **Vacancy Response Service**
   - Job application tracking
   - Interview stage management
   - Company and position information

5. **Note Service**
   - Note creation and management
   - Note association with other entities

6. **AI Service**
   - Integration with OpenAI and GPT-J

## Kafka Integration

Apache Kafka will serve as the backbone for asynchronous communication between microservices, enabling event-driven architecture.

### Kafka Topics

1. **User Events**
   - `user-created`
   - `user-updated`
   - `user-deleted`

2. **Question Events**
   - `question-created`
   - `question-updated`
   - `question-deleted`
   - `question-generated`

3. **Answer Events**
   - `answer-created`
   - `answer-updated`
   - `answer-deleted`

4. **Vacancy Response Events**
   - `vacancy-response-created`
   - `vacancy-response-updated`
   - `vacancy-response-stage-changed`

5. **Note Events**
   - `note-created`
   - `note-updated`
   - `note-deleted`

6. **Tag Events**
   - `tag-created`
   - `tag-updated`
   - `tag-deleted`
   - `entity-tagged`

7. **AI Service Events**
   - `generation-requested`
   - `generation-completed`
   - `generation-failed`

### Event Schema Management

- Use Schema Registry to manage and evolve event schemas
- Implement Avro for efficient serialization and schema evolution

### Kafka Configuration

```yaml
# Example Kafka configuration for Spring Boot microservices
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: kafka:9092
    producer:
      key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
      value-serializer: io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroSerializer
      properties:
        schema.registry.url: http://schema-registry:8081
    consumer:
      group-id: ${spring.application.name}
      auto-offset-reset: earliest
      key-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
      value-deserializer: io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroDeserializer
      properties:
        schema.registry.url: http://schema-registry:8081
        specific.avro.reader: true
```

### Event-Driven Patterns

1. **Event Sourcing**
   - Store state changes as a sequence of events
   - Rebuild state by replaying events

2. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**
   - Separate write operations (commands) from read operations (queries)
   - Optimize each for their specific requirements

3. **Saga Pattern**
   - Manage distributed transactions across services
   - Implement compensating transactions for rollback

## Migration Strategy

The migration from monolith to microservices should be incremental, following the Strangler Fig Pattern:

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Identify Service Boundaries**
   - Define clear boundaries between services based on business domains
   - Identify shared data and dependencies

2. **Refactor Monolith**
   - Reorganize code to align with future microservice boundaries
   - Reduce tight coupling between components

3. **Implement API Gateway**
   - Set up an API Gateway as the entry point for all client requests
   - Configure routing to the monolith initially

4. **Set Up Kafka Infrastructure**
   - Deploy Kafka and Zookeeper
   - Configure Schema Registry
   - Set up monitoring for Kafka

### Phase 2: Extract Services

1. **Extract User Service**
   - Move user management functionality to a separate service
   - Update API Gateway to route user-related requests to the new service

2. **Extract AI Service**
   - Move AI integration to a separate service
   - Implement Kafka communication for question generation requests

3. **Extract Question Service**
   - Move question management to a separate service
   - Implement event publishing for question-related events

4. **Continue with Other Services**
   - Gradually extract remaining services following the same pattern
   - Prioritize based on business value and technical complexity

### Phase 3: Enhance and Optimize

1. **Implement CQRS**
   - Separate read and write models for performance optimization
   - Use Kafka for propagating updates to read models

2. **Add Circuit Breakers**
   - Implement resilience patterns to handle service failures
   - Use libraries like Resilience4j or Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker

3. **Enhance Monitoring**
   - Implement distributed tracing with tools like Zipkin or Jaeger
   - Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring

4. **Optimize Data Management**
   - Implement database per service where appropriate
   - Use Kafka Connect for data synchronization between services

## Benefits and Challenges
